1. Declare a variable pageTitle with the value "Angular Data Binding Practice". Use interpolation to display the value of pageTitle in an h1 tag in the component's template. Declare two variables of integer type named a and b in the controller (ts file), and use the same variable in the template (html file) to display the sum of these two numbers in h2 tag. In next line add 10 to the sum of these two numbers in h3 tag.

2. Create a property imageUrl in the component with a link to any image of your choice. Use property binding to dynamically set the src attribute of an  tag in the template to the value of imageUrl. Create a submit button in the html, and create a toggle functionality with the disable variable. On click event, it will trigger toggleChange() function and toggle the disable variable from its last value. Take by default disable variable as false.

3. Create a button with the text "Click Me" in the template. Implement a method in the component (e.g., handleButtonClick()) that logs a message to the console when the button is clicked. Use event binding to call this method when the button is clicked.

4. Declare a variable username in the component. Use two-way binding to bind an input field to the username variable. Display the value of the username in a tag below the input field.

5. Appy conditional styling with the help of property binding of [style.color]. Declare one variable isError of boolean type with default value true. With the help of tertiary operator based on isError variable apply red, if isError is true or else apply green when isError is false.
